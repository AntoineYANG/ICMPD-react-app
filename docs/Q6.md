# Q6 - Pop/Rock

> Analyze the influence processes of musical evolution that occurred over time in one genre. Can your team identify indicators that reveal the dynamic influencers, and explain how the genre(s) or artist(s) changed over time?

## Answer

Pop/Rock is an enormous genre of modernist music. It grew into accounting for a large proportion after decades of development. Moreover, as we have proved above, Pop/Rock brows elements from other genres from first to last, mainly including Avant-Garde, Stage & Screen, etc. On the other hand Pop/Rock, this genre itself, is a very broad category with Pop music and Rock music as the main body. Rock music differed a lot from narrow pop music at its very beginning. However, through the developing of the corresponding genres, the border between them became more and more unclear to see. As for what obvious changes Pop/Rock has gone through, it has been discussed and analyzed in Q5.

We continue to use the interactive visualization tools developed in Q5, and focus on Pop/Rock. In order to distinguish the temporal variation of each artist, this color mapping in the theme river chart is replaced by a new one which is independent of the genre (Fig (?)).

To find out the dynamic influencers, we identified an indicator named style contribution. Style contribution is the product of popularity and the similarity between the artist and the later works of the total genre. We use the data of corresponding year over time. Considering that it takes time for the music ideas of an artist to be accepted and to influence the later works of the others, and the influence gradually decays and finally disappears. We contrast the data of artist described above to the works released since the second year. The statistics will end when this indicator starts to go down. Using this indicator, we checked out the ones who influenced the genre the most in each year. Table (?) is a summary (top 3) of the 1990s.
