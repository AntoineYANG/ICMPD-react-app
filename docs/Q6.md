# Q6

> Analyze the influence processes of musical evolution that occurred over time in one genre. Can your team identify indicators that reveal the dynamic influencers, and explain how the genre(s) or artist(s) changed over time?

## Answer

Pop/Rock is an enormous genre of modernist music. It grew into accounting for a large proportion after decades of development. Moreover, as we have proved above, Pop/Rock brows elements from other genres from first to last, mainly including Avant-Garde, Stage & Screen, etc. On the other hand Pop/Rock, this genre itself, is a very broad category with Pop music and Rock music as the main body. Rock music differed a lot from narrow pop music at its very beginning. However, through the developing of the corresponding genres, the border between them became more and more unclear to see. 

Thus, the main tone of this genre is constantly changing over time, along with every change of its contributors. Among these changes there is several major leaps happened to Pop/Rock. A major leap may manifest in:

* Significant increase in market share
* Rapid but obvious changes in style.

At first, we visualized the change in total popularity over time as Fig (?).a, using *full_music_data* data set and performed processing similar to the **权重分配(weight method)** defined in Q2. Similarly, we measured the changes of other attributions in *full_music_data* data set as well, displayed by parallel coordinate as Fig (?).b. Activity - in other words, the total popularity by year - of the artists is calculated and displayed by the theme river chart in Fig (?).c. The artists who contributed more than 5% of the popularity in one year is highlighted. All the charts share the same x-axis (Fig (?+1)). 

![Fig (?).a]()
![Fig (?).b]()
![Fig (?).c]()

![Fig (?+1)]()

在图 (?+1) 中，观察到 Pop/Rock 在 1955 年迎来了第一次流行度的上升期（标注为 A）。通过查找河流图，发现该时期的主要贡献者为 Elvis Presley。{ **待补充** } 由平行坐标发现， Pop/Rock 在 1960~1970 年间风格发生了很大变化（标注为 B）。这一次改变主要表现为音乐的 loudness 降低，旋律性和 liveness 提升。该时期的主要贡献者包括 The Beach Boys, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones。第二次风格的明显变化发生在 70、80 年代之交（标注为 C）， Pop/Rock 的旋律性开始下降，乐器原声的占比下降速度逐渐趋于平稳，限制级因素出现的频率开始增加，valence 也开始向消极移动。重复上述流程，我们把分析重点锁定到了 Queen, U2, John Denver, The Clash, The Who。{ **待补充** } 2000 时代的后期， Pop/Rock 的编曲旋律性在短暂的回升后转而稳定地下降，限制级因素的频率也出现反弹上升（标注为 D）。这段时期，我们主要关注 Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Ed Sheeran, Rihanna, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Twenty One Pilots。{ **待补充** }
